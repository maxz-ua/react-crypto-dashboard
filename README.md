A responsive React-based crypto portfolio dashboard that enables users to track and manage their cryptocurrency holdings. This app provides real-time updates on asset values, performance metrics, and market trends, offering an intuitive interface for monitoring digital investments. The project is built with React and showcases how to integrate **Ant Design** and **`react-chartjs-2`** to create a visually appealing, interactive dashboard.

**[Ant Design](https://ant.design/)**: Provides a set of UI components for building modern and responsive web applications.

**[react-chartjs-2](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/)**: A wrapper around the **Chart.js** library that makes it easy to add charts to React applications.
